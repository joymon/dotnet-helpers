# DotNet.Helpers
Utilities and helper classes for faster .Net development by writing less code

# What is the purpose of this helper library
This is yet another library for writing less .Net code to develop applications. Mainly focused on the functional programming concepts. To e frank C# lacks so much things which are helpful in functional programming. This will try to bride that.

# Why this helper library than others
There are so many other initiatives to generalize programming methods and are available as nuget packages. But those were not tailored to my use hence to start my own library. I could have joined with some of the libraries below but that needs extra time for communication and come to common conclusions. Feel free to try the below libraries too and sometimes those might be better suitable to you
